# Dependency Management & Express
##### by: Jos√© Alberto Jurado

## Introduction

This is the second of a series of exercises done in the Asynchronous Server Technologies course 
at ECE Paris, summer 2019. The basic NodeJS server created in [ece-ast-01-nodejs](https://github.com/juradohja/ece-ast-01-nodejs)
was replaced with Express syntax. Also, a `package.json` file was added to include dependencies. 
EJS files were also created along with modules and Bootstrap and JQuery files to implement simple GET
requests using AJAX.

## Run

To run, simply execute `npm run dev` and navigate to `localhost:8082/hello`. You may insert `name`
 as a query parameter with any value to display it on the page. You may change the port at
`index.js`.
